# Decentralized Waste Management and Recycling Incentive System

A blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes urban waste management through smart contracts, IoT integration, and tokenized incentives. The system creates a transparent, efficient, and rewarding ecosystem for all participants in the waste management cycle.

## Features

### Smart Waste Tracking
- Real-time monitoring of waste collection routes and bin fill levels
- Automated route optimization based on collection needs
- Transparent chain of custody for waste materials
- Integration with IoT-enabled smart bins for accurate data collection

### Recycling Center Operations
- Digital tracking of material processing and sorting
- Quality control verification through multi-stakeholder validation
- Automated reporting of recycling metrics and environmental impact
- Smart contract-based payment distribution to processing facilities

### Citizen Engagement and Rewards
- Mobile app for users to track their recycling contributions
- Achievement-based NFTs for recycling milestones
- Token rewards for consistent participation
- Community challenges and leaderboards

### IoT Integration
- Smart bin sensors for fill-level monitoring
- Automated waste classification systems
- QR code-based waste bag tracking
- Mobile app integration for real-time updates

## Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Layer
- Ethereum-based smart contracts for core functionality
- ERC-20 token for reward distribution
- ERC-721 tokens for achievement NFTs
- Layer 2 scaling solution for reduced transaction costs

### IoT Infrastructure
- LoRaWAN network for sensor communication
- Edge computing devices for local data processing
- Secure API gateway for data transmission
- Redundant data storage systems

### Backend Services
- Node.js API server
- PostgreSQL database for operational data
- IPFS for decentralized storage
- Redis for caching and real-time updates

### Frontend Applications
- Progressive Web App for citizens
- React Native mobile applications
- Administrative dashboard for operators
- Analytics platform for stakeholders
